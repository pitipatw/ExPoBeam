Given data 
A two-span continuous cast-in-place RC box girder bridge, with span length of 24,390 mm (L1)
and 30480mm (L2). 
The total superstructure width (W) is 10800mm

fc' = 28 MPa
Ec  = 26750 MPa (slightly more than 4700sqrt(fc') by ACI)
fy  = 420 MPa, Es = 200 000 MPa

Design based on AASHTO-LRFD 1994.
Limit State Strength I, Service I (cracks and deflections),
and Fatigue Limit States.

Determine Typical Section
AASTHO gives a minimum depths for slab/beams to around
0.033-0.070 L, where L is the span length. 
which is about 1680 mm

The section is about 10 440 mm wide and 1680 mm deep.
